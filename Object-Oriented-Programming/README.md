# Activity 1

NOTES: 
* using ArrayList for students is necessary for easier scalability 
however, ArrayList is unnecessary for Address and Parent. 
Address requires 2 slots max and Parent requires 3 slots max
probably shouldve just went for regular arrays (I might, idk).
* add public access modifiers if ever this project needs to be used somewhere else.
* Address, Parent, and Student constructors have been created to make cleaner looking code.
* did not deal with the possibility of readers to return NullPointerException
