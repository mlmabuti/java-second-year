# Activity 1 and 2

NOTES: 
* using dynamic arrays for Address and Parent is definitely overkill
* using dynamic array for students makes it easier for the program to scale
* add public access modifiers if ever this project needs to be used somewhere else.
* Address, Parent, and Student constructors have been created to make cleaner looking code.
* did not deal with the possibility of readers to return NullPointerException
